Math - Prime Numbers - Binary Primes (only contain 0, 1)

I invented these - or thought I had - in the hope of adding a sequence to OEIS.

Sadly, I included 1 at the front of my sequence, so my search revealed no entries in the OEIS.

After I submitted 2 sequences to the OEIS, I was reminded that
	1 is NOT a prime
and I found out that
	both of my sequences were already in the OEIS (without the 1).

Gutted.

Thought I had finally contributed something.
